# PEIP
MATLAB code for examples and exercises for the 3rd edition of Parameter Estimation and Inverse Problems.  For more information about the book, including a list of errata, see

This repository contains MATLAB code for the 3rd edition of "Parameter Estimation and Inverse Problems" (2018)
by Richard Aster, Brian Borchers, and Clifford Thurber.

The code in the "Examples" directory will recreate the corresponding MATLAB-based examples, including figures, for the textbook.

Ancillary files for the exercises, where needed, are located in the corresponding subdirectories of the "Exercises" directory.

To run this code, the "Lib" directory will have to be added to the user's MATLAB path.

The code should also run in Octave.  We've tested the code in Octave, but if you find any problems with running the code in Octave, please let us know about the issue.

We have had many requests to translate this code into Python.  The differences between MATLAB and Python make this a nontrivial task.  Two github repositories listed below have some of the examples converted into Python code.  We cannot vouch for the correctness of these Python codes.
