	abstract = {Marine navigation systems have very accurate sensors, such as 0.01deg/hr gyro drift stability and 0.1mg/year accelerometer bias stability. Common calibration methods and equipment do not meet the accuracy required. In this paper, a systematic method for calibration of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) for marine applications is proposed which is not based on the accuracy of the calibration turn table and only requires one specific plate to determine the initial attitude of the IMU and functions independently of the turn table. The first contribution of this paper is to derive a model for systematic calibration of IMU that expresses the rotation matrix error and velocity as a linear function of the calibration parameters at any time. As the second contribution, this paper proposes a calibration algorithm with only using an initial, specific plate. Using the actual data, it was found that the proposed algorithm provides a good estimation of the parameters.},

	ABSTRACT = {An inertial navigation system (INS) has been widely used in challenging GPS environments. With the rapid development of modern physics, an atomic gyroscope will come into use in the near future with a predicted accuracy of 5 × 10−6°/h or better. However, existing calibration methods and devices can not satisfy the accuracy requirements of future ultra-high accuracy inertial sensors. In this paper, an improved calibration model is established by introducing gyro g-sensitivity errors, accelerometer cross-coupling errors and lever arm errors. A systematic calibration method is proposed based on a 51-state Kalman filter and smoother. Simulation results show that the proposed calibration method can realize the estimation of all the parameters using a common dual-axis turntable. Laboratory and sailing tests prove that the position accuracy in a five-day inertial navigation can be improved about 8% by the proposed calibration method. The accuracy can be improved at least 20% when the position accuracy of the atomic gyro INS can reach a level of 0.1 nautical miles/5 d. Compared with the existing calibration methods, the proposed method, with more error sources and high order small error parameters calibrated for ultra-high accuracy inertial measurement units (IMUs) using common turntables, has a great application potential in future atomic gyro INSs.},
