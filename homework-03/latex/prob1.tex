\textbf{Exercise 2 in Section 3.6}

\subsection{Solution}
	
\textbf{Note: } \textit{My MATLAB code for this homework problem repeats all the steps for example 3.1 so that I can take on this problem. I will only cover the checkerboard test in this write-up.}
\newline

The checkerboard test using $\bv{m}_{true}$ can be reshaped to $\bv{m}_{true} \in \R^9$ such that

\begin{align*}
	\bv{m}_{true} = \begin{bmatrix}
		-1 & 1 & -1 & 1 & -1 & 1 & -1 & 1 & -1
	\end{bmatrix}^T
\end{align*}

which allows for the creation of test data $\bv{d}_{true}$ and a recovered model $\bv{m}_{\dagger}$.

\begin{align*}
	\bv{d}_{true} &= G \bv{m}_{true} \\
	\\
	\bv{m}_{\dagger} &= G^{\dagger} \bv{d}_{true}
\end{align*}

Recall from example 3.1 that $G \in \R^{8 \times 9}$ with rank $7$. Therefore the generalized pseudo-inverse of $G$, represented as $G^{\dagger}$, was computed using the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse function \verb*|pinv(G)| in \MATLAB. Figure \ref{fig: prob1 checkerboard test} shows how the recovered model compares to the true model.

Recall that this problem is of the situation "$p < m$ and $p < n$", in which both the model and data null spaces are non-trivial and $\bv{m}_\dagger$ is the minimum length solution. The resulting model null space vector, $\bv{m}_0 \defeq \bv{m}_{true} - \bv{m}_{\dagger}$, is shown below both numerically and graphically in figure \ref{fig: prob1 model null space vector}.

\begin{align*}
	\bv{m}_0 = \begin{bmatrix}
		\frac{2}{3} & 0 & \frac{-2}{3} & 0 & \frac{-2}{3} & \frac{2}{3} & \frac{-2}{3} & \frac{2}{3} & 0
	\end{bmatrix}^T
\end{align*}

	\caption{Model Null Space Vector}
	\label{fig: prob1 model null space vector}
\end{figure}

Notice that the sum of the model null space vector is zero. Also notice that all of the rows and columns depicted in figure \ref{fig: prob1 model null space vector} also sum to zero. The model null space vector, a.k.a. the model residual, could be restated as

\begin{align*}
	\bv{m}_0 = \sum_{i = p + 1}^{n} \alpha_i V_{.,i}
\end{align*}

where non-zero coefficients for $\alpha_i$ could create other model null space vectors. In our case we computed the minimum length solution, implying that all $\alpha_i$ coefficients are zero. The addition of this vector which resides in the model null space would have no impact on the predicted data if added to another model solution which resides in the model range space.

The three perfectly recovered model parameters are $m_2,\,m_4$ and $m_9$. When examining the model resolution matrix $R_m$ from the spike test, model parameter $m_9$ is the only parameter with perfect resolution.

Model parameters $m_2,\,m_4$ are subject to "smearing" due to the limited resolution. In this situation, this could have caused us to assume that model parameters $m_2,\,m_4$ also have perfect resolution, when instead the smearing for the parameters just happened to bring these model parameters to zero.
