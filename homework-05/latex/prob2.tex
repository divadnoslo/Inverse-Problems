\textbf{Exercise 8 in Section 9.6}

\subsection{Solution}

\subsubsection{Part A}

Equation 9.60 was implemented in \MATLAB using the provided constants within the function \verb|prob2Function()|. This function doesn't only compute equation 9.60, but actually returns the residuals scaled by the standard deviation. 

A \verb|meshgrid| was created with independent variables $\epsilon$ and $T$. Each point in the \verb|meshgrid| are a combination of the model parameters, and surface over top is the $\chi^2$ function. The surface generated is in \ref{fig: prob2 chi2 surface}.

The minimum value on this surface is $7.312$, which corresponds with model parameters $\epsilon = 7.05 \times 10^{-4},\,\,\,T = 7.05 \times 10^{4}$. 


\subsubsection{Part B}

To compute the 95\% confidence interval for our solution, we would prefer to use equation 9.41 over equation 9.39 since we are able to avoid computing the Jacobian of equation 9.60. 

The region of the 95\% confidence interval is bounded by the value $\Delta^2$. The value $\Delta^2$ was computed using the function \verb|chi2inv()| in the \verb|Lib| directory with the degree of freedom $\nu =9 - 2 = 7$, which resulted in a value of $\Delta^2 = 14.0637$. The model parameters on the \verb|meshgrid| which resulting in a $\chi^2$ value less then $\Delta^2$ are highlighted in green, while value not in the region are in red in \ref{fig: prob2 chi2 surface 95 conf}.

This region does not resemble an ellipse, which was never a guarantee.
